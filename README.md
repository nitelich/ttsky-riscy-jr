# Tiny Tapeout RISCY Jr.

[Read the documentation for the RISCY Jr. project.](docs/info.md)

The RISCY Jr. project was tested locally using Icarus Verilog and in an FPGA using a custom MiSTer FPGA core. A quick ["local compile test"](src/local_compile_test.bat) script is given in the source directory. However, the full development test benches, scripts, and test ROMs are not made available as part of this repository. The Tiny Tapeout testbenches have not been instrumented beyond the basic suggestions made in [test/README.md](test/README.md)

This project is [open source and free software](LICENSE) under an Apache v2.0 license. Author's Note: As a personal project that I have poured more time into than I'd care to admit, the only reason I'm using an Apache v2.0 license is to conform to Tiny Tapeout's terms and conditions. Working in an embedded systems job for years has jaded me horribly to the state of "open source" and "free" software, particularly when hosted on a publicly available and well-known platform like github.
