# Tiny Tapeout RISCY Jr.

[Read the documentation for the RISCY Jr. project.](docs/info.md)

The RISCY Jr. project was tested locally using Icarus Verilog and in an FPGA using a custom MiSTer FPGA core. A quick ["local compile test"](src/local_compile_test.bat) script is given in the source directory. However, the full development test benches, scripts, and test ROMs are not made available as part of this repository. The Tiny Tapeout testbenches have not been instrumented beyond the basic suggestions made in [test/README.md](test/README.md)

The RISCY Jr. project is open source, but it [is not free software](LICENSE). The portions of this repo derived from the Tiny Tapeout template repo are released under an Apache v2.0 license.
